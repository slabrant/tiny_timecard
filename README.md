# tiny_timecard

## Project Scope
- I want a very small timecard that is highly compatible across browsers
- It should require minimal install/setup
- This is partially a training project, so I don't want to use any third-party libraries
- This timecard relies entirely on local storage
  - The data can be downloaded to a csv and stored in a separate system
- This is created around my workflow and does not have customization options
  - Ctrl + S will save the data to local storage and will not allow downloading the page as normal
  - Adding a new entry will insert the current time as the stop time of the previous entry
